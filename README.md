A Python Web Crawler and Search Engine, using MySQL.


In repeating a personal project from a year or two ago, I'll beable to judge where I have improved and where I haven't.

This time I plan on making a web interface search engine, to learn about backend web development (Django).

So far, the search engine is quite basic.
I orders the sides per query based on the amount of pages that link to them.
